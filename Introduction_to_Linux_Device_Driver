---------------------------
                            hardware
                            
                            
the communication between the user space and driver must pass by the kernel drivers
the user space use system call to communicate with the kernel.




*Linux kernel modules
peace of code that can be loaded or unloaded upon demand

Type: 

static kernel modules:
dynamique kernel modules

Advantage :
no need to recompile the kernel evry time 
load and load evry time .

*Device driver 

software application that interact with hardware device.


*Device Driver 

-Linux treats evry things as device file
-device file is an interface for device driver
-devices files are stored under /dev/

*Device Driver Types

-Character device
-block device
-network device


*Character device driver 

hardware file that read /write data  character by character
example:mouse ,key board

*Block Device 
hardware file that read /write by block instead of character by character
example:HDD ,USB


*network device driver 

hardware file that read/write data to network device network
